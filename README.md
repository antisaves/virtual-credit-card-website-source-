kind of a short put simple website

in # 539 you will find the webhook to enter, you could encrypt you're code and send it via email or whatever you choose 

once the user enters a name then click "generate card" it will log the users info on a discord webhook

you can change the website name/layout and the webhook to something else to send the information to
